Monster23 WordPress theme is inspired by my love for the day to day events that you experience with your kids that no one usually ever hears about. As a mother you do not have time to share, and when you do, you usually forget. Monster23 is a perfect fit for the hardworking, busy, and tired parents that want to get a quick laugh or tear and read again later down the road. (Just about anyone with a blog idea can use this theme too. You don't have to be a parent. Promise.)  Some other great features are privacy options, gallery configuration, simplicity, and minimalism.
